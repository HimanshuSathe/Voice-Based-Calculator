                    We developed this project under the guidance of our faculty guide Dr. S.R. Balasundaram sir and our team consists of two members Himanshu Sathe (205121043) and Nikhil Chawre (205121063). We created this project as part of our summer intern under our guide.

                    Our project is on Voice-Based Calculator that allows us to perform arithmetic operations using our voice and manually too.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This calculator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the Web Speech API to recognize voice commands and perform calculations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We can use it to perform calculations hands-free, which makes it ideal for situations where we don't have access to a keyboard or mouse.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To use this calculator, simply click on the microphone icon and speak command. For example, we can say "two plus two" to perform the addition operation, or "five multiply ten" to perform multiplication. The calculator will display the result on the screen, and we can continue using it to perform additional operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We hope you find our Voice-Based Calculator useful and easy to use.
